# Version 0.1.0: Initial Frontend

## Problem Statement

During the early stages of frontend development, we encountered the challenge of creating a flexible, feature-rich platform capable of handling multiple roles and providing tailored experiences for each type of user (students, teachers, institutions). We needed a UI that allowed users to easily register, authenticate, and manage their organizations, while also enabling the creation of public-facing websites with minimal friction. Additionally, the platform had to support dynamic content rendering, drag-and-drop functionality, and real-time previews to meet the evolving needs of its users.

## The Decision to Use

To address these challenges, we decided to use **React.js** as the core library for building the user interface, due to its component-based architecture and state management capabilities. **TypeScript** was chosen for type safety and improved developer productivity, especially as the project scaled. We integrated **GrapesJS** as the site builder for its drag-and-drop functionality, allowing users to design their organizationâ€™s websites easily.

Key components of the frontend architecture included:

- **User Registration and Authentication**: Leveraging form management for secure registration with social media login options (Google, GitHub).
- **Organization Management**: An admin dashboard where authenticated users could create and customize organizations.
- **Site Builder**: A flexible page builder with pre-built templates and real-time editing features for organization websites.
